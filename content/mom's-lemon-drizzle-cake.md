One of my favorite recipes as a kid was my mom’s lemon cake. This cake
is incredibly easy to make, and bakes perfectly every time ... moist
and tart. I prefer to serve the cake cold, which makes it a great,
light treat on a summer evening.

## Cake

Preheat oven to 350°.

* 1 3/4 cups flour
* 1 1/3 cups sugar
* 3 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt

Put dry ingredients in mixer and stir until combined.

* 1 cup milk
* 4 eggs
* 3 oz package lemon jello
* 3/4 cups vegetable oil
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon flavoring
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Add remaining ingredients and blend well.

Grease and flour a 13×9" glass baking dish, and pour cake into
dish. Bake 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick comes clean.

## Frosting

* 2 c powdered sugar
* zested rind and juice of 1 lemon

Mix frosting ingredients in a small bowl. Poke cake numerous times
with a large fork, then pour frosting over the cake.

Cool completely before serving.
