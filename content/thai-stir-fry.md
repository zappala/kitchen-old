I love Thai curries, but rarely make them at home because Tracy most
definitely does not like them. Since Tracy is out of town, I figured
Iâ€™d try my hand at something new. I made up a curry-based stir fry, to
try to lighten what is typically a pretty heavy dish. I started with a
bunch of fresh vegetables, added only a small amount of chicken,
tossed in some oranges, and then used just a small amount of pre-made
curry sauce so I had the flavor of the curry in the dish, but not as
much liquid as a typical curry dish. Went over very well with my kids!

* 1 large onion
* 1 red bell pepper
* 2 handfuls of snap peas
* 2 navel oranges
* 1 1/3 pounds chicken breast
* 1 1/2 cups jasmine rice
* 1/2 jar of Thai Kitchen yellow curry sauce (11 ounce jar)
* olive oil
* 2-4 tablespoons red wine

Cut onion into strips, coarsely chop bell pepper, and remove ends of
peas. Cut chicken into chunks. Cut orange into wedges and remove peel.

Cook rice with 2 to 2 1/2 cups water, starting on high and turning
down to medium low once the rice boils. Cover and simmer until the
water is absorbed.

While the rice cooks, stir fry each vegetable individually in a wok
over medium heat with enough olive oil to prevent it from
sticking. Remove each vegetable to a dish as they cook. Stir fry
chicken over medium heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. Remove and
add to the bowl with the vegetables.

Add red wine to pan to deglaze it, scraping bits with a spatula, and
simmer to cook off the alcohol. Add curry sauce, mix, and bring to a
simmer. Add in all the vegetables, the chicken, and the oranges. Mix
until sauce covers the meat and vegetables. Serve over rice.

Makes 5 to 6 servings.
