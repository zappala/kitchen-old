My family loves this basic waffle recipe from an old, battered copy of
[The Joy of
Cooking](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/411107.The_Joy_of_Cooking),
a classic cookbook that we’ve had for a while.  We use this recipe so
much, I’ve got the page in the cookbook memorized. To make enough for
everyone in our family, this recipe is doubled from what is in the
cookbook. We use our Waring waffle iron, with a small amount of oil
brushed on before the first waffle and again halfway through.

* 3 1/2 cups flour
* 4 teaspoons double-acting baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 6 eggs, separated
* 4 tablespoons melted butter
* 3 cups milk

In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, salt and
sugar. Set aside.

Separate the yolks from the egg whites. Put the yolks in a medium bowl
and combine with melted butter and milk. Mix into the dry ingredients,
leaving the batter lumpy.

Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold into the batter.

Makes about 12 waffles.
