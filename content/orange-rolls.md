One of our favorite long-weekend recipes comes from the Pillsbury
cookbook, *The Complete Book of Baking*. If you want to see rolls
disappear as fast as you can make them, this is a great recipe to
make.

## Basic Sweet Roll Dough

* 6 to 7 cups flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoon salt
* 4 1/2 teaspoon yeast
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 1 egg

Mix together 2 cups flour and, sugar, salt, and yeast. In a small
saucepan, combine water, milk and butter. Heat until very warm using
medium heat. Add warm liquid and egg to dry ingredients. Blend until
moistened and then beat for 2 minutes.

Stir in additional flour, until a good dough forms. If using a stand
mixer, when adding the last cup, add 1/4 cup of flour at a time and
mix with a dough hook. If not using a stand mixer, knead in the flour
by hand. Either way, the dough should be smooth to the touch when
done.

Place dough in a greased bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap and a
cloth towel, and let rise for an hour in a warm place.

## Rolls

* 1/2 recipe of Basic Sweet Roll Dough
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons grated orange peel

On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into an 18×12
rectangle. Spread with melted butter. Combine sugar and orange peel,
mix well, and sprinkle over dough. Roll up the dough from the long
side, so that it is 18 inches long. Cut with a serrated knife into 18
slices, each one inch thick. Place on a greased baking sheet, cover
with plastic wrap and a cloth towel, and let rise for 45 minutes in a
warm place.

Heat oven to 350°. Uncover dough, and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until
lightly brown. Immediately remove from baking sheet and cool on a wire
rack.

## Icing

* 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 to 2 tablespoons orange juice

Mix together icing ingredients in a small bowl, using as much orange
juice as you need to get the desired consistency. Spread over warm
rolls.
