Emma decided to make a key lime pie and used [Paula Deen’s
recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/key-lime-pie-recipe/index.html)
from the Food Network. This was a complete surprise to me, as I had no
idea she was busy in the kitchen, but look what a treat it was:

Wow, my 13-year-old daughter made that?

Here’s the recipe:

## Crust

Preheat oven to 350°.

* 2 cup graham cracker crumbs
* 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
* 1/2 cup butter, melted

In a medium bowl, combine cracker crumbs and brown sugar. Stir in
melted butter. Press the mixture into bottom and up sides of a 10-inch
spring form pan. (Note, Paula Deen recommends a spring form pan, but
as you can see below we used our large ceramic dish.)

Bake for 8 minutes and let the crust cool completely.

## Pie Filling

* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 12-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
* 3/4 cup lime juice
* 1 Tablespoon lime zest
* 1 pint half-and-half

Pour whipping cream in a mixer and beat on medium speed until slightly
thickened. Gradually add the sugar, beating until soft peaks form. Add
condensed milk and beat until stiff peaks form. Beat in lime juice,
zest, and half-and-half. Once the mixture has reached desired
consistency, gently spread pie filling over cooled crust.

Cover and freeze for 4 to 6 hours or until firm. Cut into wedges and
garnish with whipped cream and fresh lime slices.

Here is what Emma’s finished pie looked like:
