When Tracy and I were married, one of our gifts was a cookbook titled
[The Treasury of Creative Cooking](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3994211-the-treasury-of-creative-cooking), by the editors of Consumer Guide. As
we practiced cooking, we enjoyed trying some of the Chinese dishes in
the book, and we often came back to this recipe for Chinese chicken
salad. While it is probably not very authentic, we always enjoyed it
as a light, cold meal on a summer day. We tried it out for our kids
today, and they couldn’t get enough of it! Sadly, we were too used to
cooking this version, which makes enough for 5 or 6 servings, but is
woefully inadequate for three teenagers. This is a recipe you’ll need
to double.

## Chicken

* 3 whole chicken breasts
* 4 cups water
* 1 tablespoon dry sherry
* 2 slices pared fresh ginger, or 1 t powdered ginger
* 2 whole green onions

Combine chicken, water, sherry, ginger, and green onions in a large
saucepot or wok. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for
20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until cool, then shred.

## Salad

* 4 cups lettuce, shredded
* 1/2 cup napa cabbage, shredded
* 1/4 cup red cabbage, shredded
* 1 carrot, shredded
* 3 green onions, chopped
* 1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped

Add salad ingredients to a large salad bowl. Add chicken.

## Rice Threads

* 1 handful of rice threads

Rice threads usually come in a fairly large package. You will only
need a handful and can save the rest for another time.

Heat 2 inches of oil in a medium skillet on medium-high until hot
enough for stir frying, about 400°. Drop in a handful of rice
threads. If the oil is hot enough, the threads should immediately
puff. Remove and drain. I often like to use less oil, in which case I
will turn over the threads and repeat on the bottom side for any that
weren’t done.

## Dressing

* 1/4 cup Chinese plum sauce
* 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon dry mustard

Combine dressing ingredients in a small bowl and stir until
mixed. Pour over salad and chicken mixture and toss to cover
evenly. Serve with rice threads on top or on the side.

Makes 5 – 6 servings.
