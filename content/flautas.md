I don’t think these flautas are very authentic, with a filling that
combines chicken, tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. I’ve yet to find
a Mexican restaurant that makes them this way. I can’t even remember
where I originally got the recipe; it may have been the LA Times web
site. But it was a long time ago, and since then I’ve adapted it
fairly heavily. A lot my family recipes end up that way. Regardless,
my family loves them!

I used to make these all at once, but they are so much better fresh
than reheated, so I now make only a half batch and then save the rest
of the filling and tortillas for a second day of crispy goodness. I
don’t like to deep fry foods, so I add just a small amount of oil to a
pan and fry briefly on both sides.

## Filling

* 4 boneless chicken breasts
* 1 medium onion
* 2 medium bell peppers
* 3 tablespoons cooking oil
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 medium can whole tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 3 tablespoons chili powder
* oregano to taste
* salt to taste

Cut onion into slices and stir fry with some oil in a large skillet
over medium heat. Remove and set aside. Repeat with the bell peppers.

Cut chicken into bite size pieces and stir fry over in the same
skillet with a small amount of oil.  Add to the onions and peppers.

In a blender, purée the canned tomatoes. Add last amount of oil to
pan, with some garlic. Stir fry briefly, then add tomatoes,

In blender, puree the canned tomatoes. Add to pan, with cumin, chili
powder, oregano and salt. Simmer over medium low heat 15 minutes until
thickened. Add chicken, onions, and peppers and stir to coat. Remove
from stove.

## Flautas

* 12 – 16 flour tortillas
* toothpicks

To assemble flautas, add some chicken mixture to each tortilla, roll,
and secure with a toothpick.

Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Be sure the oil is
completely heated before frying. Fry three or four flautas at once,
turning one time, so that the tortillas turn golden brown,
approximately 2-3 minutes.

Serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole on the side.
